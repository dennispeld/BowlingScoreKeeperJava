# Bowling Score Keeper Java
The *BowlingScoreKeeper* console app was written in Java language using Java SDK 13 and JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA. 

Added new validation that checks if both bowls for each frame are less or equal to 10. The score cards are also updated with new format.

### The logic of Score Keeper is very simple:
* Each player has one game
* The game consists of 10 frames
* Each frame has 2 throws and a score

### Tested combinations (one player):
NORMAL   [1, 5] [3, 6] [7, 2] [3, 6] [4, 4] [5, 3] [3, 3] [4, 5] [8, 1] [2, 6] is 81  
STRIKE  [10, 0] [3, 6] [7, 2] [3, 6] [4, 4] [5, 3] [3, 3] [4, 5] [8, 1] [2, 6] is 94  
SPARE   [1, 9] [3, 6] [7, 2] [3, 6] [4, 4] [5, 3] [3, 3] [4, 5] [8, 1] [2, 6] is 88  
STRIKE & SPARE  [10, 0] [4, 6] [7, 2] [3, 6] [4, 4] [5, 3] [3, 3] [4, 5] [8, 1] [2, 6] is 103  
STRIKE AS THE LAST FRAME [1, 5] [3, 6] [7, 2] [3, 6] [4, 4] [5, 3] [3, 3] [4, 5] [8, 1] [10, 0] is 92 (last throws are [7, 2])  
SPARE AS THE LAST FRAME [1, 5] [3, 6] [7, 2] [3, 6] [4, 4] [5, 3] [3, 3] [4, 5] [8, 1] [2, 8] is 90 (last throw is 7)
